## Mapping High-Performance Accelerators in Domain-Specific Architectures

**Description:**
Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have driven major advances in academia, with direct impact on industry, agriculture, and society. However, these applications require a computational workload that is growing exponentially compared to hardware advancements. Current processors are struggling to keep up with performance demands, even with the support of accelerators such as GPUs. Another important challenge is the high energy consumption of existing computer architectures when performing this type of processing.

This project aims to develop new Domain-Specific Architectures (DSA) that provide high performance while prioritizing energy efficiency.

## GT-SmartSeg – Working Group on Smart Contract Security  
**Period:** 2024 – Present  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Type:** Research  

**Description:**  
Auditing the security of smart contracts is essential to prevent vulnerabilities in decentralized applications (DApps) deployed on networks such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Although several tools exist to detect vulnerabilities, their adoption faces challenges such as discontinued or closed-source projects and the need to configure different execution environments.  

This project aims to develop an automated framework for executing smart contract security verification tools, integrating security auditing into the DApp development lifecycle. The framework will be integrated with RNP and will be compatible with blockchain networks such as Hyperledger Besu and Ethereum. It will also include updates to detect new vulnerabilities through fuzzing techniques.  

The main benefits include audit automation, reduced costs compared to traditional security audits, and broader access to verification tools. The system will be accessed through a web interface that manages containers configured to run multiple tools and can be adapted to different blockchain networks. The project will also provide documentation, demonstration videos, and performance reports.

## Federated Multimodal Authentication Using Biometric Signals  
**Period:** 2023 – Present  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Type:** Research  

**Description:**  
The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) requires security and privacy mechanisms for storing, transmitting, and processing personal data. Biometric authentication aims to provide protection in human-machine interactions.  

This project focuses on developing tools and methodologies for multimodal biometric authentication in IoHT environments using machine learning techniques. Combining multiple biometric signals enhances security, reduces user interaction, and enables liveness detection. The project uses ECG (Electrocardiogram), PPG (Photoplethysmography), and brainwave signals from real users available in public datasets. A proprietary dataset is also expected to be developed and shared to advance the state of the art.  

The proposed solutions are designed to operate on resource-constrained devices typical of IoHT environments.

## Using Heterogeneous Cloud Computing to Accelerate Gene Regulatory Network Simulations  
**Period:** 2020 – 2022  
**Status:** Completed  
**Type:** Research  

**Description:**  
Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are dynamic graph-based models widely used in bioinformatics, including studies of cell differentiation, metabolism, and disease evolution such as cancer. Simulating the full state space of a GRN with *n* nodes requires \(2^n\) steps, limiting studies to relatively small networks.  

This project developed tools and techniques to enable efficient, scalable, and transparent high-performance GRN simulations using heterogeneous cloud computing with GPUs and FPGAs. Execution times were reduced by up to four orders of magnitude, enabling the exploration of larger networks.  

The tools support dynamic model construction and runtime adjustment and can be integrated with widely used biological software such as Cytoscape. All developed tools were made publicly available to the research community.
